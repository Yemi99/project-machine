# Project-Machine

# Proposal:
Our project is to predict whether we should buy or sell ethereum. We'll use the Alpaca API to query ETH data and fit an SVC classifier model to predict whether the price of bitcoin is expected to go up or down each day. We'll also fit a deep neural network model and a random forest algorithm to determine which model has the best predictive power.
